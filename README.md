# TicTacToe
Programmed for my COP 3253 Advanced Java Programming course at FSU.

After cloning the repository, there are four ways to play. The command line usage is `java TicTacToe [-c [1|2]]`

### To run straight from the jar file:
* `java -jar hw3.jar` for human vs human
* `java -jar hw3.jar -c` for computer vs computer
* `java -jar hw3.jar -c 1` for human (as X's) vs computer (O's)
* `java -jar hw3.jar -c 2` for computer (as X's) vs human (O's)

Enjoy!
